# my website

This is the source code for my personal website. You can visit it at www.kennedyford.xyz 
It is currently quite simplistic and is a work in progress.

It is currently being hosted through Netlify. I purchased a domain, and I am using the Netlify DNS. Netlify is pulling the code to host from this repository as it is changed. Thus, whenever I change any aspect of this repository, it will then be pulled by Netlify and updated within a few seconds of my commitments.<br>

Recent Update: The website now also has a SSL/TLS given through Netlify which allows HTTPS to be enabled for secure browsing.
