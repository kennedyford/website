# my website

This is the source code for my personal website. You can visit it at www.kennedyford.xyz 
It is currently quite simplistic and is a work in progress.

It is currently being hosted through Netlify. My URL is using the Netlify DNS and I am pulling the code to Netlify from this repository. 
Recent Update: The website now also has a SSL/TLS given through Netlify which allows HTTPS to be enabled for secure browsing.
