# my website

This is the source code for my personal website. You can visit it at www.kennedyford.xyz 
It is currently quite simplistic and is a work in progress.

It is currently being hosted through Netlify. My URL is using the Netlify DNS and Netlify is pulling the code to host from this repository as it is changed. <br>

Recent Update: The website now also has a SSL/TLS given through Netlify which allows HTTPS to be enabled for secure browsing.
